### 1. Download Helm Charts

Download all the `.tgz` files from `https://charts.aetherproject.org/`

```bash
wget -r -A .tgz https://charts.aetherproject.org/
```

### 2. [Install helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

### 3. Build and Deploy on Github Pages

Go to `Repository-setting` --> `Code and automation` --> `Pages` --> `Build and Deployment` --> `Branch` -- Select `main`

Wait for few minutes and then your site will be live at ` https://username.github.io/repository/`.

### 4. Generate `index.yaml`

This command will generate an `index.yaml` file in the `charts.aetherproject.org` directory. The `--url` flag sets the base **URL** that the charts can be found at in the generated `index.yaml` file.

```bash
helm repo index charts.aetherproject.org --url https://username.github.io/Aether_Project_Charts/

# move the index.yaml in the parent directory
mv charts.aetherproject.org/index.yaml .
```

### 5. Generate `README.md`

```bash
wget -O - https://charts.aetherproject.org/ > README.md
```

### 6. Limit Access

The `robots.txt` file is a file at the root of your website that indicates those parts of your site you donâ€™t want accessed by search engine crawlers. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, which is a protocol with a small set of commands that can be used to indicate access to your site by section and by specific kinds of web crawlers (_such as mobile crawlers vs desktop crawlers_).

```bash
echo -e "User-Agent: *\nDisallow: /" > robots.txt
```
